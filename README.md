# tinder-finder

Search Tinder for a specific person


### Use
Allows you to provide filters (name, gender, age, location, etc) as well as update your own settings (gender, location, etc) to find profiles matching your filters

### Background
Built off the [Unofficial Tinder API documentation gist](https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467) with the intention of helping a friend find someone who was impersonating them on Tinder

### [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) vars

```language=clojure
{:fbook-token Facebook auth token (instructions in [gist](https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467) on how to obtain)
 :fbook-id Accesible in above method but is also the custom id in your facebook url if you added on
 :tinder-token Tinder access token, retrievable with `tinder/get-auth-token` once you have your fbook info set
 :clarifai-token [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) API token*
 :search-name First name of user you are searching for
 :search-school School of person you are searching for
 :search-bio Bio (full or partial) of person you are searching for
 :search-tags If you are looking to do an image tag comparison you first get the tags of the original photo with Clarifai}
```

### Todo
* real error handling

### Shortcomings
- Built this for my use-case, adjust code as necessary to use different filters than those provided
- Tinder API can change
- Rate-limiting with Tinder `/recs` call
- Using a tool that does true image comparison would provide more accurate results than using just identifiying tags. For my use it was good enough as I had a set of fairly unique search tags and didn't mind filtering through the resulting photos but you can always replace Clarifai with a different API/lib (one SO suggestion explored was [OPENCV](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html)).
- Clarifai API has a 5k limit/month
